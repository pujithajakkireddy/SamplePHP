# My First PHP App

## Project Description
This is a simple web page created as my very first project while learning PHP. The goal of this project is to set up a local development environment and practice basic Git and GitHub workflows.

The page displays a welcome message and confirms that the PHP server is running correctly.

## Technologies Used
* **PHP:** The server-side scripting language used to generate dynamic content.
* **HTML5:** The markup language for structuring the web page.
* **XAMPP (or WAMP/MAMP):** The local server environment used for development.
* **Git:** The version control system used to track changes.
* **GitHub:** The remote repository for storing the project code.

## How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/pujithajakkireddy/SamplePHP.git](https://github.com/pujithajakkireddy/SamplePHP.git)
    ```
2.  **Move the project to your web server directory:**
    * Place the `SamplePHP` folder inside the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\SamplePHP`).
3.  **Start your local server:**
    * Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache service.
4.  **View in your browser:**
    * Navigate to `http://localhost/SamplePHP/` in your web browser.
